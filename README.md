# Pymaceuticals Analysis

In  the Pymaceuticals Analysis we look to evaluate different mice from the csv file that we are pulling. We then attempt to extract necessary Data and present the results in various charts and visuals.

### We look to accomplish the following

* Clean our dataset of duplicate values and remove them

* Present the clean data as a summary statistics table

* Generate Pie and bar charts of specific data from our clean set

* Find outliers and present them in a box and whisker

* Create line and scatter plots based on Drug regimen

* Finally we create a correlation and regression chart based on the weight and Tumor volume
